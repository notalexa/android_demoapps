# Demo Challenges

This project defines demo apps for the AOSP extension as defined in 
[The AOSP Project](https://github.com/notalexa/aosp_extensions#readme).
Four demo challenges are introduced:

1. The first is a joke. No challenge needs to be solved.
1. The second is [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29). The cookie files follow the normal convention (separated by `%`) with an additional entry `%%TITLE%%` used to set the title in the app and are assumed to end with `.u8`. Additional cookie files can be placed in the assets/fortune folder or in assets/fortune/de (for german) and assets/fortune/en (for english) cookies. The initial files were taken from a standard unix installation. No challenge needs to be solved. Just tab on the cookie.
1. A simple math challenge.
1. An emoji challenge to identify common emojies. The emojies in the app were taken from the [OpenMoji Project](https://openmoji.org).

All icons are taken or derived from the [OpenMoji Project](https://openmoji.org).
